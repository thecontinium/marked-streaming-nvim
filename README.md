# Streaming Vim to Marked

This requires the PyObj library to be installed in the python environment used by neovim.
The call to stream the buffer including the extractiion of the text in the buffer and streamed to marked is asynchronous

This is dependent on the python library PyObjC being installed in the same environment as pynvim.



``` bash
pip install PyObjC
```
